Webdock is a simple html-app for managing your daily notes. Your notes are saved at the localstore of your browser. You can save your
notes to dropbox (share it to other browsers).

Try it: https://webdock.fischel.org

I personally use it for sharing my notes between office and home.

## install

Clone this project (or load a zip file) to your favorite document root. If you want to save your notes to Dropbox
you have to setup https (http is available for localhost only).

There is a [tutorial](https://webdock.fischel.org/dropbox.html), how to setup a datastore.
